        <p>Our first video call was nothing short of a dream. It was drizzling outside, the soft sound of rain making everything feel so romantic. My heart was pounding as I waited for the call to connect, excitement and nervousness mixing together. And then ‚Äî there she was ‚Äî my girlfriend, looking absolutely breathtaking in a red suit. Ufff‚Ä¶ the way the color complimented her, the glow on her face, and that shy yet beautiful smile ‚Äî it felt like time stopped. But just as things were getting perfect, my mom suddenly walked into the room! My heart skipped a beat, but somehow, I managed to hide myself and confidently continue the call, pretending nothing happened. Seeing her laugh at my little escape made it even more special. That moment ‚Äî the rain, the rush of hiding, and her dazzling red suit ‚Äî it all felt so perfect, like a scene straight out of a romantic movie. That first video call wasn‚Äôt just a call ‚Äî it was the start of something unforgettable. ‚ù§Ô∏èü•∞ üíñ</p>
